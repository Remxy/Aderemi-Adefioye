Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using R programming

This work was carried out as my capstone at Ryerson University as a student of Data Analytics, Big Data and Predictive Analytics.
It was done to show how to extract insight from tweet scraped throup API and retrieved datasets.
This was an academic endeavour and not for commercial purpose(s).
